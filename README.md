## Introduction

The Firesale Trigger Framework is an automatic reconnaissance and exploitation tool designed to assess the security posture of various infrastructure sectors worldwide. It leverages cloud resources to create multiple instances on known cloud providers and then performs targeted attacks on critical infrastructure sectors. This framework is intended for educational and research purposes only and should not be used for any malicious activities.

## Features

- **Multi-Cloud Support**: The framework can deploy instances across various cloud providers to maximize its global reach.
- **Targeted Attacks**: It focuses on critical infrastructure sectors including banking, manufacturing, oil & gas, insurance, healthcare, ISP, energy & power, government, and water systems.
- **Automatic Reconnaissance**: The framework automates the reconnaissance phase, identifying potential targets within the specified sectors.
- **Exploitation**: Once targets are identified, the framework offers a suite of tools to assess vulnerabilities and potential exploit vectors.
- **Reporting**: Comprehensive reports are generated to provide insights into the security posture of targeted infrastructures.
